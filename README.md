## üéÆ [Live Demo](https://tic-tac-toe-flux30s-projects.vercel.app/)

An elegant implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with two variants: a traditional version and an advanced version with unique rules. Both games feature an intelligent AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Two Game Variants:**
  - **Classic Tic Tac Toe**: The traditional 3x3 grid game
  - **Advanced Tic Tac Toe**: A variant limiting each player to three pieces on the board
  
- **Intelligent AI Opponent:**
  - Powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
  - Optimized for challenging but fair gameplay
  
- **Modern UI/UX:**
  - Responsive design for all devices
  - Smooth animations using GSAP
  - Dark theme with elegant visual elements
  
- **Mathematical Analysis:**
  - Detailed visualization of game complexity
  - Analysis of optimal strategies
  - Data-driven insights on game states

## üß† Game Rules

### Classic Tic Tac Toe
- Players take turns placing X or O on a 3x3 grid
- First player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins
- The game ends in a draw if the board is filled without a winner

### Advanced Tic Tac Toe
- Each player is limited to three pieces on the board
- When placing a fourth piece, the player's oldest piece is removed
- This creates a more dynamic gameplay experience with shifting strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity
- GSAP for advanced animations
- Chart.js for data visualization

## üîç Implementation Details

The AI implementation uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate possible moves:

```javascript
function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing, alpha, beta) {
    // Recursive evaluation of game states
    // Returns optimal score for current player
    // ...
}
```

The game includes several key optimizations:
- Board state caching to avoid redundant calculations
- Symmetry detection to reduce the search space
- Progressive depth search based on game stage
- Performance optimizations for mobile devices

## üìä Mathematical Analysis

The repository includes a detailed mathematical analysis page that explores:
- Game theory aspects of Tic Tac Toe
- State space complexity for both game variants
- Proof of optimal play resulting in draws
- Visualization of the decision tree
